        <p>Hi, I'm Ulf.</p>
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer who came in sideways. I learned BASIC on a C64, taught myself C++, and fell into the
            web out of necessity. I don't love buzzwords, but I do love systems — especially the ones that surprise me.
            I care more about clarity than cleverness, and more about making things legible than making them cool. To
            me, software is both communication and construction — and I'm most at home when it's treated as both.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
            What I do
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
            In June 2025, I left my full-time role to find a better fit — technically and culturally. I work best in
            environments where engineers are trusted to own problems and given the autonomy to solve them well.

            Since then, I've been deepening my skills, experimenting with different tools and frameworks, and building a
            job application manager in Go. I'm now looking for a team that values thoughtful engineering, clarity, and
            continuous improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a strong background in web development across both frontend and backend. I enjoy working with
            TypeScript, React, and Node.js, but I'm comfortable with a wide range of languages and frameworks. I like
            building things. And I like improving how we build them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            In my free time, I code a lot. My current project is a web app to help users manage job applications. It's
            built in Go with Templ for server-side rendering, using JSON for persistence.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
            What I did
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
            I've worked as a software engineer for about five years, mostly in web development.</p>
        <p>
            I started out as a full-stack developer, building a web application for ecologists to visualise simulated
            pollen distribution. I created a pipeline using C++, PHP, HTML, and JavaScript that let users map maize
            fields and simulate particle spread in the browser. The simulation engine was based on AUSTAL, a model for
            low-density particle dispersion.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was my first experience with web development. And I loved it.
        </p>
        <p>
            My biggest lesson back then: don't cook your own TIFF images. There are libraries for that.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
            What I build
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
            I like building things — often more than finishing them. Recently I prototyped over twenty
            iterations of a web app just to explore the web development landscape. I tried different languages,
            frameworks, rendering modes, state management approaches, routing strategies, and architectural styles.
            Here's some of what I learned:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There's rarely a reason to use JavaScript over TypeScript. Exceptions are early-stage prototypes where
                raw speed outweighs the benefits of types and tooling.
            </li>
            <li>
                React is a powerhouse for UIs. Next.js is currently the best framework for building TypeScript-first
                applications. It's not perfect and it nudges you into Vercel's ecosystem, but it offers excellent UX
                with a DX that's hard to beat.
            </li>
            <li>
                React isn't the only way. Vanilla JS is still viable, but frameworks help — a lot. Vue and Nuxt are
                great alternatives. I especially appreciated Nuxt's auto-import features.
            </li>
            <li>
                Try Svelte if you haven't. It's a joy to work with. I haven't used SvelteKit yet, so I can't compare it
                to Next.js or Nuxt, but the client-side experience is excellent. The compiler does a lot for you while
                keeping the language transparent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phoenix LiveView is a standout. It's the most exciting thing I've tried in recent years. I didn't fully
                commit only because of the Elixir learning curve and some MVC-related indirection borrowed from Rails.
                But LiveView is a real innovation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Laravel and Spring Boot are solid, but not for me. They rely too much on “magic” for my taste, which
                makes debugging painful. While React and Phoenix also have their quirks, their advantages outweigh the
                costs — unlike Laravel and Spring Boot, which I found less compelling.
            </li>


        </ul>
        <p>
            Right now, my job application manager app is implemented in Go using Templ for server-side rendering.
            Offloading logic to the server simplifies things so much that I haven't missed frontend frameworks. Since
            most of the logic is in Go, I didn't even need TypeScript. I've also opted out of SPA entirely — the
            Transition API covers most of what I need, and the difference is hardly noticeable in dev. Deployment might
            break the illusion, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.
