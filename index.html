        <p>Hi, I'm Ulf.</p>
        <p>I currently wrestle with Javascript.</p>
        <p>I started coding BASIC on a Commodore 64 around 1990.</p>
        <p>
            In between I explored C, C++, Python, PHP, Object-oriented Programming,
            Game Development, Linux Administration, LAMP, Procedural Graphics
            Programming, Data Visualization, UI, UX, WordPress, AJAX, jQuery, React,
            Next, GUI with QT, functional programming, LISP, Modding (Games),
            No-Code, Low-Code, Design Patterns, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Typescript,
            Jest, Mocha, Vite, reverse engineering, golang, Java, Bootstrap, TDD,
            Defensive Programming, Security, Refactoring, Hot Spot refactoring,
            Linters, Static Code Analysis, Code Quality, Cognitive Complexity, git,
            GitHub, gitflow, GitHub actions, S3, CI/CD, SVG and animation. The list
            is not ordered neatly yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also studied Social Work, Sociology, spent a lot of time with
            workplace studies, Ethnomethodology and Psychology, Management related
            topics like XP, agile and lean.
        </p>
        <p>
            But it's actually not important anymore if I already dabbled with Elixir
            or how familiar I am with concurrency. I plainly love development.
            Learning new ways to get to the next level. Growing with a team. Foster
            trustful relationships and usable pipelines that enable flowing and fun
            iterations.

            <h1>The soft in software</h1>
            <p>
                We sometimes use the term 'hard coded' when writing something like
                <code>const withTaxes = sum * 1.19</code>. The tax of 19% can change
                and if it does, we have to find all the spots where this number was
                used. In some cases the code might be written like this though:
                <code>const total = sum * 19 / 100</code>. So we would miss it if we
                searched the document for <i>1.19</i>. In this context most developers
                would recognize what the number 19 means. But it could also be
                something like this original piece of code from the source of
                <i>Quake III Arena</i>:
                <code> i = 0x5f3759df - ( i &gt;&gt; 1 ); // what the fuck?</code>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">(read more)</a>
                The comment at the end is telling. The tax number is pretty easy to
                fix. Instead of writing the number, we use a variable. We can pass it
                by value in the function where it is used. If we really 'need' to, we
                could use a global variable, even if global variables are frowned
                upon. If it was at least immutable, it would be difficult to do much
                harm. In some cultures, devs use SCREAMING_CASE to mark globals. Then
                we would write like this:
                <code>const withTaxes = sum * TAX_RATE</code>. It sticks out quite a
                lot. Which I like. Now everyone knows we are bad developers, because
                we use globals ;). In a small application this could actually work ok.
                It might not be the best idea anywhere else. Context does matter. It's
                still better than writing out the number for anything but throw-away
                code though.
            </p>

            <h2>What's the point?</h2>
            <p>
                Well, yes. I mean, this is actually not a good example for hard
                challenges in larger teams, because if not one person on a team sees a
                problem in the use of 'magic numbers', I do not think it will survive
                very long. I could be wrong, but that's my guts opinion. Magic numbers
                are not the only and by far not the worst problem to have. They make
                changes hard, but it's still pretty fixable. At least in the case of
                simple numbers like a tax rate. The number in the fast inverse
                square root algorithm that ID Software came up with is also actually
                not a big problem as long as it is never changed and only used in one
                place. Things do get more difficult when the meaning of a value is not
                clear and even more difficult when they get used at seemingly random
                places in the source code. I hope you can imagine why that could cause
                pain.
